                <h2>About Me.</h2>
                <p>My name is Brianna and I am currently a student of Graphic Design at Algonquin College.</p>

                <p>Through my studies, I have developed a solid foundation in design principles and have gained experience with a variety of design tools, including Adobe Creative Suite (Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign), Figma, and Sketch. </p>

                <p>I am passionate about typography, layout design, and branding. I have also had the opportunity to experiment with other areas of design, such as motion graphics and web design.</p>

                    <h4>Logo Creation</h4>
                    <p>Your logo is the face of your brand and the first thing that potential customers will see, so it's crucial to
                    make a great first impression. I can help create a logo that is both visually stunning and effective in representing your
                    brand.</p>

                first
                impression. I can help you create a website that not only looks great but also functions flawlessly and engages
                your target audience.</p>

                <h4>Full Branding</h4>
                <p>Your brand is much more than just a logo or a website. It's the overall image that your business presents to the
                world,
                including the look, feel, and voice of your brand. I can help you create a cohesive and impactful brand that
                resonates
                with your target audience and sets you apart from your competitors.</p>
